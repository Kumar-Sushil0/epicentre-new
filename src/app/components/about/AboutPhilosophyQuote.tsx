            Modern life is saturated with input.<br />
            Noise is constant.
            Performance is rewarded.<br />
            Stimulation is engineered.
            Most people do not lack intelligence or intuition.<br />
            They lack uninterrupted attention.
            The Silent Club exists as a calibration chamber.<br />
            External identities are temporarily suspended.
            Relational and professional roles pause.<br />
            Only first names remain.
            You do not leave life here.<br />
            You prepare to re-enter it deliberately.
