            Modern life is saturated with input.
            Noise is constant. Performance is rewarded.<br />
            Most people do not lack intelligence or intuition.
            They lack uninterrupted attention.<br />
            The Silent Club exists as a calibration chamber.
            External identities pause.<br />
            You do not leave life here.
            You prepare to re-enter it deliberately.
